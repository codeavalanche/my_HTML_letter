            <div class="fourth">
                <p>This letter is meant to officially appeal to the managements and staffs of the rivers state ICT department in charge of the techcreek codegaminator 10.0 training to see to the computers that are not working. some of the students dont have a personal computers so they rely only on the computers in the center for practice and this computers are now limited due to the fact that some of them are not working. it will be most appropriate for these students to gain the necessary practical knowledge they've all come to acquire. we look forward to hear from the managements as regarding this plea thank you.</p>
                <p>And also i will like to suggest that the students registered for the frontend codegaminator classes be allowed to use the open work cafe after classes for practice. sometimes most of the students get to go home not because they really want to go home but because they've not been allowed to practice after the training. and for some of them practice immediately after classes helps them to gain more understnding of what has been taught.</p>
